# RedditOS
A SwiftUI Reddit client for macOS

This is bleeding edge, you need macOS Big Sur beta and Xcode 12 beta.

If you want to login with your Reddit account building the project from the source you'll need to create a file `secrets.plist` in `Packages/Backend/Sources/Backend/Resources` with your Reddit app secret as `client_id` key/value.

I'll periodically release pre built version of the app in the repository. 

The app is still early and SwiftUI on macOS is not that fast (yet) but I'm planning to release it on the Mac App Store with the release of Big Sur.
